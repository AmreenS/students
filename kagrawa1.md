2 year Masters student in Computer Engineering, I am working on project called XALT (NICS). 
XALT will track linkage and execution information for applications that are compiled and 
executed on any linux cluster, workstation or hig-end supercomputer. Although the product 
is not live yet, however once live we would be expecting huge volumes of data. This data
would have to be analyised, mined and visualized for improving efficiency and effectiveness 
of an extensive community of stakeholders. I am looking forward to this coruse, as this 
will help me improve my data analytics skills.
